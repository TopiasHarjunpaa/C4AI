# Weekly report 2

### What I have done during this week?

On sunday, I created setup view which allows user to change different player setups such as player vs. player or player vs. AI etc. I also created preliminary AI (chooses game coin locations randomly) and adjusted game loop logic so that AI development can be started.

On monday, I did spent most of the time for creating unit and integration tests. I also created preliminary base for the ai service class and for its tests. On top of that, I did some small refactoring for the UI classes.

On tuesday, I created preliminary heuristic value calculation for game scenarios. This also involved quite a lot changes for the existing code and for that reason I spent most of the time modificating the code structure and tests.
