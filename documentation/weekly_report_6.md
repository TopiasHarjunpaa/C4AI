# Weekly report 6

### What I have done during this week?

On Sunday I continued working with documentation. Primarily for the implementation documents. Meanwhile I also did some minor refactoring in order to keep project structure as mentioned at the implementation document.

On monday I continued working with documentation. I created user instruction document which still needs updated link for the final release. I also updated implementation and testing documents which both are close to finished. For the implementation document I perhaps may add a class diagram and list of improvement ideas. For the testing document I may add few words about simulation file but that file actually would need some reworking. Another option would be just to remove whole file entirely as it was made for comparing old implementations.
