# Weekly report 3

### What I have done during this week?

On sunday, after extended weekend break from the project, I mainly re-wrote and added new docstring and improved testing coverage. I also did some minor changes for some methods, such as renaming and re-ordering their structures.

On monday, I continued updating the docstring and did most of the unit tests for the current services. There are still some tests missing especially for the game services. I also added possibility to run two different levels of AI algorithms and checkings for the situation when game has ended in draw. On top of that, did some improvements for the UI, suchs as background image and logos. I know that it is not best way to spend time as it is not the primary scope for this project. However, I still have to run the software plenty of times and I'd like that it looks just little bit better. This being said, I still may update the game board and game coins looks, which should not take too much time.

On tuesday, I started creating some improvements for the UI such as drawing game board and coins. I expected that to be quick job to implement, but suddenly I realised spending almost whole evening for doing that. I am still not satisfied for the looks of the UI, but I decided to not spend more time on that as long as there are work left to do with the algorithms. Perhaps at the end of the project I may do some minor tuning if I have time left.

On wednesday I started finally implementing new stuff for the AI. I had studied earlier some methods to optimise Minimax algorithms and decided to give a go for iterative deepening. I think I managed to somehow do that, but I need to take a further look for that tomorrow and implement tests as well. I also managed to break one test for the game loop services which needs to be fixed.
