# Weekly report 3

### What I have done during this week?

On sunday, after extended weekend break from the project, I mainly re-wrote and added new docstring and improved testing coverage. I also did some minor changes for some methods, such as renaming and re-ordering their structures.

On monday, I continued updating the docstring and did most of the unit tests for the current services. There are still some tests missing especially for the game services. I also added possibility to run two different levels of AI algorithms and checkings for the situation when game has ended in draw. On top of that, did some improvements for the UI, suchs as background image and logos. I know that it is not best way to spend time as it is not the primary scope for this project. However, I still have to run the software plenty of times and I'd like that it looks just little bit better. This being said, I still may update the game board and game coins looks, which should not take too much time.
